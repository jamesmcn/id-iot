# id-iot: The Social Network for Bad People

## Motivation

Past social networks assumed that people are basically good and only
need occasional nudges to encourage them to avoid bad behavior. The entirety
of human history suggests a different perspective: humans are basically
bad and need a significant amount of encouragemenet to be good.

### joke explainer

If you reviewed the code or just complied and ran it, you may have noticed
that all messages are dropped on the floor and nothing is read from your
social graph. Particularly astute readers will note that there is no social
graph at all. This is by design. Everything works perfectly!
